 * Queries are wrapping filters and are assembled in a query tree. Each query is

 * the filter. The graph that is passed to the filter depends on the fact the
 * query belongs to a complex query tree or if the tree is a single leaf.
 * <p>
 * The system works like this. Leaves of the query tree receives the complete
 * graph and the subgraphs they return are passed to the parent query. Thus the
 * root query is the last query to get the subgraphs and returns the final
 * result. This querying system make possible to create query chains and complex
 * scenario with various operators (AND, OR, ...).

 * Queries are built by the <code>FilterController</code> from filter instances.
