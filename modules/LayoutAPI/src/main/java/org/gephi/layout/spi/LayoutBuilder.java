/**
 * A <code>LayoutBuilder</code> provides a specific {@link Layout} instance. The
 * Builder pattern is more suitable for the Layout instantiation to allow
 * simpler reusability of Layout's code.
 *<p>
 * Only the LayoutBuilder of a given layout algorithm is exposed,
 * this way, one can devise different layout algorithms (represented by their
 * respective LayoutBuilder) that uses a same underlying Layout implementation,
 * but that differs only by an aggregation, composition or a property that is
 * set only during instantiation time.
 *<p>
 * See <code>ClockwiseRotate</code> and <code>CounterClockwiseRotate</code> for
 * a simple example of this pattern. Both are LayoutBuilders that instanciate
 * Layouts with a different behaviour (the direction of rotation), but both uses
 * the RotateLayout class. The only difference is the angle provided by the
 * LayoutBuilder on the time of instantiation of the RotateLayout object.
