/**
 * Interface modules implement to notify the system they can read/write part of
 * the .gephi project file to serialize states and data.
 * <h3>How saving a project works</h3>
 * <ol><li>The saving task is looking for all implementations of this interface
 * and ask each of them to write data either in XML or binary. Each
 * implementation is identified by its identifier, which is provided through
 * <code>getIdentifier()</code>.
 * <li>All of these elements are written in the .gephi project file.
 * </ol>
 * <h3>How loading a project works</h3>
 * <ol><li>The loading task is looking for all implementations of this interface
 * and asks for the identifier returned by <code>getIdentifier()</code>.
 * <li>When traversing the gephi project document it call the provider read
 * method.
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Thus this interface allows any module to serialize and deserialize its data
 * to gephi project files.
 * <p>
 * In order to have your <code>WorkspacePersistenceProvider</code> called, you
 * must annotate it with
 * <pre>@ServiceProvider(service = WorkspacePersistenceProvider.class, position = xy)</pre>
 * The <code>position</code> parameter is optional but often useful when when
 * you need other <code>WorkspacePersistenceProvider</code> data deserialized
 * before yours.
