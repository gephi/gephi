/**
 * Workspace interface that internally stores, through its <b>Lookup</b>,
 * various information and instances.
 * <p>
 * Workpace is a top concept in Gephi because all models that modules possesses
 * are usually divided by workspace, for instance one
 * <code>GraphModel</code> per workspace. Therefore this class has a Lookup
 * mechanism to let modules store their model in the workspace's lookup and
 * query it when needed.
 * <p>
 * To know how you can manage loading and saving data in Gephi project files,
 * see {@link WorkspacePersistenceProvider}.
 * <h3>How to associate new data model to the workspace</h3>
 * In your new module, listen to {@link WorkspaceListener} and call
 * <code>add()</code> method when initialize:
 * <pre>public void initialize(Workspace workspace) {
 *      workspace.add(new MyDataModel())
 *}
 * </pre> When a workspace is selected, retrieve the workspace's data model:
 * <pre>public void select(Workspace workspace) {
 *      MyDataModel model = workspace.getLookup().lookup(MyDataModel.class);
 *}
 * </pre>
