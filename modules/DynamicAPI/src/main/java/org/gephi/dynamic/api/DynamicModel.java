/**
 * Model that maintains the dynamic states of the application, which include the
 * minimum and the maximum bounds, as well as the current visible interval.
 * <p>
 * The min and the max are used to know what are the limits of the time in the
 * current data. The visible interval is typically configured by a timeline
 * component to select a range of time. The model also maintains what is the
 * current time format, either
 * <code>DOUBLE</code> or
 * <code>DATE</code>. Internally, all times are double, but it can be converted
 * to dates for user display. In addition the model stores the current
 * estimators used to compute dynamic values.
 * <p>
 * The model is listening to graph and attributes events to track all intervals
 * and deduce minimum and maximum. It thows
 * <code>MIN_CHANGED</code> or
 * <code>MAX_CHANGED</code> events when these values are changed.
 * <p>
 * The model can also build {@link DynamicGraph} objets on demand. These objects
 * can work independently to states of this model.
