/**
 * <b>Please note that the methods offered in this service are the same as Data
 * Laboratory nodes manipulators. It is possible to reuse actions
 * implementations by adding both <code>ServiceProvider</code> annotations.</b>
 * <p>
 * Interface from providing graph context menu items as services.
 * <p>
 * All context menu items are able to:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Execute an action</li>
 * <li>Provide a name, type and order of appearance (position in group of its
 * type)</li>
 * <li>Indicate whether they have to be available (appear in the context menu)
 * or not</li>
 * <li>Indicate whether they have to be executable (enabled in the context menu)
 * or not</li>
 * <li>Provide and icon or not</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Used for different manipulators such as NodesManipulator, EdgesManipulator
 * and GeneralActionsManipulator.
 * <p>
 * The only methods that are called before setting up an item with the data are
 * <b>getSubItems, getType and getPosition.</b>
 * This way, the other methods behaviour can depend on the data that has been
 * setup before
 * <p>
 * <b>getSubItems will be called before and after setup. Take care when the
 * nodes are null!</b>
 *
 * To provide a context menu item, a class has to implement this interface and
 * have a <code>@ServiceProvider</code> annotation
