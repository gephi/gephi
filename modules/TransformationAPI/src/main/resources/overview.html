            Layout API/SPI provides real-time layout algorithms execution.
        </p>
        <p>
            The API let users control execution of a layout algorithms. It also
            gathers various information about an algorithm to present it to the
            user in a pleasant way.
        </p>
        <p>
            How must a Layout algorithm look like is defined in the
            <code>org.gephi.layout.spi</code> package. Layout algorithm have
            access to the graph structure and can define properties users can
            change in real-time when algorithm is running. Utility graph
            transformations like Random or Rotate can also be defined as Layout
            algorithms.
