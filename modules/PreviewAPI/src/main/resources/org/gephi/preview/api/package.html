            API for Preview rendering.
        </p>
        <p>
            This API hosts preview properties, items and renderers to control
            preview displays. Preview is using the current Graph to build a set
            of visual items. <b>Items</b> have a generic data container and are built 
            within <b>Item Builders</b> implementations. <b>Renderers</b> are stateless 
            singletons which renders items to a render target and have a list of
            fixed properties. <b>RenderTarget</b> is the graphic container:
            Java2D, PDF or SVG.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Preview is highly customizable and allows any plug-in to implement or
            override existing renderers or item builders. Consult the SPI package
            for more details.
