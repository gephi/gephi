name=Force Atlas
description=Force Atlas makes graph more compact, nicer than Fruchterman Rheingold and can takes node size in account.

forceAtlas.inertia.name = Inertia
forceAtlas.inertia.desc = Conservation of node speed at each new pass
forceAtlas.repulsionStrength.name = Repulsion strength
forceAtlas.repulsionStrength.desc = How strongly does each node reject others
forceAtlas.attractionStrength.name = Attraction strength
forceAtlas.attractionStrength.desc = How strongly does each pair of connected nodes attract each other
forceAtlas.maxDisplacement.name = Maximum displacement
forceAtlas.maxDisplacement.desc = This is limiting each node's displacement (to prevent some super-rejecting when nodes are too close)
forceAtlas.freezeBalance.name = Auto stabilize function
forceAtlas.freezeBalance.desc = Activates the freezing of unstable nodes. Despite some loss of efficiency, this prevents most of nodes flickering
forceAtlas.freezeStrength.name = Autostab Strength
forceAtlas.freezeStrength.desc = Power of the auto stabilize function
forceAtlas.freezeInertia.name = Autostab sensibility
forceAtlas.freezeInertia.desc = [0,1] This parameters represents the auto-adaptiveness of the anti-flickering function (actually, the freezing inertia)
forceAtlas.gravity.name = Gravity
forceAtlas.gravity.desc = This force attracts all nodes to the center to avoid dispersion of disconnected components
forceAtlas.outboundAttractionDistribution.name = Attraction Distrib.
forceAtlas.outboundAttractionDistribution.desc = The attractive force is distributed along outbound links. This tends to push hubs at the periphery and put authorities more central
forceAtlas.adjustSizes.name = Adjust by Sizes
forceAtlas.adjustSizes.desc = Avoid nodes overlapping (depending from the size of each node)
forceAtlas.speed.name = Speed
forceAtlas.speed.desc = Value > 0 defaut 1 ; permits you to increase convergence speed at the price of a precision loss
