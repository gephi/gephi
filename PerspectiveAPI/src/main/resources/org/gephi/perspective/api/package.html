        API for perspective management.
        <p>
            A perspective is a set of panels in the user interface. <b>Overview</b>,
            <b>Data Laboratory</b> and <b>Preview</b> are the default perspectives.
        </p>
        <p>
            The API simply allows to control the currently selected perspective.
        </p>
        <p>
            The SPI provides the interfaces to implement new perspectives. Top
            components can attach themselves to one or several perspectives by
            using the <code>@TopComponent.Registration</code> annotation.
