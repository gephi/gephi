<!--
  This is a target library which is intended to be used by other build scripts.
  
  It contains the standard, fucntionality, common across all scripts which 
  allows to perform some basic initialization, check out sources from a cvs 
  repository and, finally, clean or build a netbeans project and jni libraries.
  
  None ot the targets defined in this script are intended to be called 
  directly, instead it is expected that targets in build dcripts which import 
  this one will declare dependecies on this script's targets.
