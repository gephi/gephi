# Gephi - The Open Graph Viz Platform

[Gephi](http://gephi.org) is an open-source platform for visualizing and manipulating large graphs. It runs on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. Localization is available in French, Spanish, Japanese and Brazilian Portuguese.

- **Fast** Powered by a built-in OpenGL engine, Gephi is able to push the envelope with very large networks. Visualize networks up to a million elements. All actions (e.g. layout, filter, drag) run in real-time.

- **Simple** Easy to install and [get started](http://gephi.org/users/quick-start/). A UI that is centered around the visualization. Like Photoshop™ for graphs.

- **Modular** Extend Gephi with [plug-ins](http://gephi.org/plugins/). The architecture is built on top of Netbeans Platform and can be extended or reused easily through well-writen APIs.

[Download Gephi](http://gephi.org/users/download/) for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux and consult the [release notes](https://wiki.gephi.org/index.php/Gephi_Releases). Example datasets can be found on our [wiki](https://wiki.gephi.org/index.php?title=Datasets).

## Install and use Gephi

Download and [Install](http://gephi.org/users/install) Gephi on your computer. 

Get started with the [Quick Start](http://gephi.org/users/quick-start/) and follow the [Tutorials](http://gephi.org/users/). Load a sample [dataset]((https://wiki.gephi.org/index.php?title=Datasets)) and start to play with the data.

If you run into any trouble or have questions consult our [forum](http://forum.gephi.org).

## Developer Introduction

Gephi is developed in Java and uses OpenGL for its visualization engine. Built on the top of Netbeans Platform, it follows a loosely-coupled, modular architecture philosophy. That allows it to be used build large applications and to grow in a sustainable way. Gephi is split into modules, which depend on other modules through well-written APIs. Plugins can reuse existing APIs, create new services and even replace a default implementation with a new one.

Consult the [**Javadoc**](http://gephi.org/docs) for an overview of the APIs.

### Checkout and Build the sources

- Fork the repository and clone

        git clone git@github.com:username/gephi.git

- Run ant or [open the project in Netbeans](http://wiki.gephi.org/index.php/Build_Gephi)

        ant

### Create Plug-ins

Gephi is extensible and lets users create plug-ins to add new features, or to modify existing features. For example, you can create a new layout algorithm, add a metric, create a filter or a tool, support a new file format or database, or modify the visualization.

## Gephi Toolkit

Gephi is not only a desktop software, it's also a Java library named [Gephi Toolkit](http://gephi.org/toolkit/).

The project packages essential modules (Graph, Layout, Filters, IO…) in a standard Java library, which any Java project can use for getting things done. The toolkit is just a single JAR that anyone could reuse in new Java applications and achieve tasks that can be done in Gephi automatically, from a command-line program for instance.
