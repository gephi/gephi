[Gephi](http://gephi.org) is an award-winning open-source platform for visualizing and manipulating large graphs. It runs on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. Localization is available in English, French, Spanish, Japanese, Russian, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese, Czech and German.

- **Fast** Powered by a built-in OpenGL engine, Gephi is able to push the envelope with very large networks. Visualize networks up to a million elements. All actions (e.g. layout, filter, drag) run in real-time.

- **Simple** Easy to install and [get started](https://gephi.github.io/users/quick-start). An UI that is centered around the visualization. Like Photoshop™ for graphs.

- **Modular** Extend Gephi with [plug-ins](https://marketplace.gephi.org). The architecture is built on top of Netbeans Platform and can be extended or reused easily through well-written APIs.

[Download Gephi](https://gephi.github.io/users/download) for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux and consult the [release notes](https://github.com/gephi/gephi/wiki/Releases). Example datasets can be found on our [wiki](https://github.com/gephi/gephi/wiki/Datasets).

## Developer Introduction

Gephi is developed in Java and uses OpenGL for its visualization engine. Built on the top of Netbeans Platform, it follows a loosely-coupled, modular architecture philosophy. Gephi is split into modules, which depend on other modules through well-written APIs. Plugins can reuse existing APIs, create new services and even replace a default implementation with a new one.

Consult the [**Javadoc**](http://gephi.github.io/gephi/0.9.2/apidocs/index.html) for an overview of the APIs.

### Requirements

- Java JDK 7 or 8 with preferably [Oracle Java JDK](http://java.com/en/).

- [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) version 3.2.2 or later

### Checkout and Build the sources

- Fork the repository and clone

        git clone git@github.com:username/gephi.git

- Run the following command or [open the project in Netbeans](https://github.com/gephi/gephi/wiki/How-to-build-Gephi)

        mvn clean install

- Once built, one can test running Gephi

		cd modules/application
		mvn nbm:cluster-app nbm:run-platform

### Create Plug-ins

Gephi is extensible and lets developers create plug-ins to add new features, or to modify existing features. For example, you can create a new layout algorithm, add a metric, create a filter or a tool, support a new file format or database, or modify the visualization.

- [Plugins Quick Start (5 minutes)](https://github.com/gephi/gephi/wiki/Plugin-Quick-Start)

- Browse the [plugins](https://marketplace.gephi.org/) created by the community

- We've created a [**Plugins Bootcamp**](https://github.com/gephi/gephi-plugins-bootcamp) to learn by examples.

## Gephi Toolkit

The Gephi Toolkit project packages essential Gephi modules (Graph, Layout, Filters, IO…) in a standard Java library which any Java project can use for getting things done. It can be used on a server or command-line tool to do the same things Gephi does but automatically.
