        This documents provides Gephi APIs documentation and gives details about
        current status of each API. Each API is categorized by it's stability:
        stable, <span class="unstable">under development</span>, <span class="deprecated">deprecated</span> or
    <span class="friend">friend</span>.

    <h2>API Changes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>(June 02 2010) Changes in AttributesAPI with event management. The lookup system in <code>AttributeTable</code>
        has been replaced by a more traditionnal event management system, with new <code>AttributeEvent</code> and
        <code>AttributeListener</code> interfaces. The dispatch implementation is also now on a separate thread.</li>
        <li>(May 08 2010) Changes in Import modules to separate core and user interfaces. The <code>ImportController</code> is now
        doing import task only and a new <code>ImportControllerUI</code> is displaying the user interface (Report Panel). The
        <code>ImportControllerUI</code> interface is located in the DesktopProject module and should be user to properly
        import file from Plugins. The <code>ImportController</code> methods could be used from the toolkit.</li>
        <li>(April 30 2010) Change FilterController.filter() to FilterController.filterVisible()  and FilterController.select()
            to FilterController.selectVisible(). The controller is managing this process in a separate thread, with progress,
            and takes care of properties change. A more simple direct way to filter is required for headless access.
            The FilterController.filter()  has been created and return the GraphView builded by the filter process.</li>
        <li>(April 24 2010) Expose basic visualization features in a newly created Visualization API. No proper visualization
            API exists but its creation is necessary to avoid implementation module dependencies. </li>       
        <li>(April 17 2010) In PreviewAPI, the background color has been put in the PreviewModel. The PreviewController has
            been updated as well. </li>
        <li>(March 28 2010) Add a <code>doImport()</code> method in <code>ImportController</code> that accepts
            <code>InputStream</code>. In ImportAPI also, add <code>getWeight()</code> in EdgeDraft to let importers
            increment weight. New <code> AttributeUtils</code>  methods. Progress in GraphAPI and ImportAPI documentation.</li>
        <li>(Feb 17 2010) Change in ImportAPI to support bounded time intervals. Add methods
				that manage <code>TimeIntervalMin</code> and <code>TimeIntervalMax</code>. Changes in
				GraphAPI about elements counting. Henceforth only enabled elements are counted, in node
				and edge counting, but also in degree methods. This counting is more logical, as it match
				with the number of elements returned by <code>getNodes()</code> and <code>getEdges()</code>.</li>
        <li>(Feb 7 2010) Initial import, for 0.7alpha milestone. Half of
            APIs are fully documented and the rest needs to be soon. Expose
            only Core APIs, that plugins could need by now. Friend
            packages exists, in particular between Plugin and PluginUI
            modules but they are not shown here. Netbeans APIs documentation
            dependencies are missing, thus see
            <a href="http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/index.html">Netbeans API Index</a>.
            Due to early development status, most of APIs are still marked as
            under development. Moreover APIs marked as stable are also suspected to
            change, but with much less impact than ones marked as under development.</li></ul>
